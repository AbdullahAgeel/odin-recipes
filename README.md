# Recipe website project

This project is a basic recipe website created to test/practise my knowledge of HTML. 

The website will consist of a main index page which will link to a few of our favourite recipes.

 The website will have a brutalist design and to be brutally honest it isn't really made to look pretty (just yet). 

 I hope to demonstrate basic HTML skills once I have completed this project
