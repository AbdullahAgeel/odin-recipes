  <h2>Mbakbaka, a delicious libyan pasta dish you have probably never heard of</h2>
  <p>Mbakbaka is the dish I'm sure every libyan grew up eating (alot). It is an easy one pot pasta where all the ingredients cook together in one pot, and so the delicious flavours of the ingredients all fuse together to make this final masterpiece. Another amazing thing about mbakbaka is that it doesn't need many ingredients, just literally take whatever you have in your fridge and start cooking. If you have chicken then you can make chicken mbakbaka, if you have meat then you make meat mbakbaka and so on. So what are you waiting for, its delicious, quick, easy to cook and relatively unexpensive. Get cooking! </p>
