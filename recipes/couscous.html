    <h2>Couscous or as Libyans call it, Cousksi, is a North African dish adored by many who have had the pleasure of putting it in their mouths (pause)</h2>
    <p> This North African dish originated in Morocco and slowly spread in the North Africa region to neighbouring countries such as Algeria, Libya and Tunisia. Each country added their own twist to the dish. The dish we will be focusing on here is the Libyan version of couscous called 'Cousksi'. Libya added carmelized onions, stew and a touch of spice to the original dish. That is why you will notice that the libyan version has a red colour which is in contract with the Moroccan white version.This dish it is not easy to make or master, Libyan moms learned how to perfect this dish with time and practise. Its recipe is may seem easy due to the low number of ingredients but don't let that fool you! </p>
